## 📜 Project Background

This project was initiated as part of my professional advancement under the **Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP)** in the Philippines. As a software engineer and innovator, I envisioned a **modular, AI-enhanced autonomous combat drone** system that can serve both **civilian and military applications**.

The need for indigenous, self-reliant defense systems, aligned with the **Philippine Self-Reliant Defense Posture (SRDP)**, inspired me to begin this ambitious R&D project.

## 🧠 Strategic AI Drone R&D Journey

### Phase 1: Ideation & Research
- Identified global trends in drone warfare and autonomous UAV systems.
- Researched various drone configurations: fixed-wing, VTOL, ducted fan, and missile-style.
- Investigated the feasibility of **off-the-shelf components** for low-cost modular deployment.

### Phase 2: System Design
- Started building the software from scratch using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON**.
- Designed a responsive **drone swarm command interface**.
- Developed key functions:
  - Radar targeting system
  - Real-time drone status (active, ready, destroyed)
  - Coordinated flight formations
  - Evasive maneuvers & collision avoidance
  - Live lead-camera feed with fallback

### Phase 3: Hardware Integration
- Integrated **radar sensors**, **cameras**, and **navigation modules** using Arduino.
- Simulated flight formation and combat targeting using **mock JSON data**.
- Designed and tested **3D printable parts** using CAD tools for wings, fuselage, and missile bays.

### Phase 4: Proposal & Validation
- Created whitepapers, pitch decks, and evaluation documents.
- Prepared for formal submission to:
  - **DND (Department of National Defense)**
  - **AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines)**
  - **DOST (Department of Science and Technology)**
- Project aligns with **naval applications** and **airstrip-launched multi-mission drones**.
